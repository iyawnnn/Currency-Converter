# Currency Converter

The Currency Converter works by utilizing a dictionary (`exchange_rates`) containing exchange rates for each currency relative to others. Users input a base currency, specify the amount to convert, and select the target currency. The program calculates and displays the converted amount based on the provided exchange rates.
